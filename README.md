Particle filter localization using tactile sensors for robotic applications in challenging environments


Robots are increasingly being deployed in various hazardous and challenging environments, such as disaster response, search and rescue, and nuclear facility inspection. In these situations, traditional perception sensors like LiDAR and vision systems can malfunction or provide inaccurate information due to the presence of smoke, dust, or other obstructions. Therefore, it becomes essential to explore alternative localization methods that can help robots navigate these complex scenarios more effectively.

In this project, we focus on localizing CHAMP, a quadrupedal robot, in a known map by utilizing force/torque sensors attached to its feet. The aim is to develop a localization scheme that can provide reliable navigation information even when conventional perception sensors fail. The particle filter, also known as the Monte-Carlo filter, is employed as the core localization algorithm for this purpose. The proposed method was also tested and simulated on TurtleBot, a popular mobile robot platform, by adding eight bumpers to achieve tactile sensing capabilities.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed force/torque sensor-based localization approach enables the robot to achieve partial localization within the known map, even in challenging environments where conventional perception sensors may malfunction. Although the localization is not fully precise, it provides valuable navigation information for both CHAMP and TurtleBot in situations where other sensors are not reliable or available. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed method for enhancing robot navigation in hazardous and complex scenarios while also suggesting that further improvements and refinements may be necessary for achieving complete and accurate localization.

The paper is included in this repo. I'll upload the codes when they're ready.

Note:  I stoped working on this project when I graduated, and now I'm focusing on my graduate studies.
